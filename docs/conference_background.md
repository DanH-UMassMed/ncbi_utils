The Molecular and Cellular Biology of Lipids GRC is a premier, international scientific conference focused on advancing the frontiers of science through the presentation of cutting-edge and unpublished research, prioritizing time for discussion after each talk and fostering informal interactions among scientists of all career stages. 

The conference program includes a diverse range of speakers and discussion leaders from institutions and organizations worldwide, concentrating on the latest developments in the field. 

The conference is five days long and held in a remote location to increase the sense of camaraderie and create scientific communities, with lasting collaborations and friendships.

The Molecular and Cellular Biology of Lipids Gordon Research Conference and Seminar will provide a platform for scientists from various sub-disciplines of lipid biology, biochemistry, and biophysics to present and discuss their most recent discoveries that impact the field. 

The overarching focus is on the “Regulation of the Structure and Function of Lipids and Lipid Metabolizing Enzymes in Signaling and Metabolism”. 

This focus reflects the unique aspects and incredible diversity of lipids and their associated enzymes in regulating signaling pathways, membrane environments, metabolic pathways, and gene transcription to affect physiology and pathophysiology. 

The diversity in both lipid type and distribution plethora is important to the various roles various lipids they play in these processes. 

Modulating the levels of various lipids in different organ and subcellular compartments requires specific regulation of various lipid metabolizing enzymes. These enzymes are unique in that their substrates are hydrophobic or at least amphipathic. This imposes special requirements for the regulation and chemistry underlying their function. 

This conference focuses on understanding how the structure, chemistry, and dynamic distribution and regulation of these enzymes modulate lipids to affect signaling and metabolism. 

Invited speakers will anchor nine plenary sessions, and we will select 14 of the 36 talks from the submitted abstracts to capture the most recent groundbreaking research. 

Overall, this conference is designed to attract a variety of lipid researchers focused on different areas of lipid research to foster a productive exchange of ideas and encourage collaborations.
