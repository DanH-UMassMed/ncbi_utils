This is for organizing the Gordon Conference, I want to find papers from the topics and make sure I’m not missing anything new in the literature.  But these topics are broad, so regular pubmed gives me a lot of crap and I’d been doing searches on the journal pages, which is also cumbersome. 


1. Lipid peroxidation/ferroptosis (MG)
   - a. Jenny Watts (UW Pullman) [Prior Speaker]
   - b. Valerian Kagan (Univ Pittsburgh)
​
 
2. Lipid asymmetry (AKW)
    - a. Ilya Levental (UVA Charlotsville) [Prior Speaker]
    - b. Chris Burd (Yale)
 
3. Membrane contact sites, lipid transport, and compartmental localization (MG)
    - a. Prof. Jeeyun Chung (jeeyunchung@fas.harvard.edu)
    - b. Hanaa Hariri [Prior Speaker]
    - c. Maya Schuldiner
 
4. Lipids in normal biology and disease (AKW, MG)
    - a. Infectious disease

6. Tools (AKW)
- a. Industrial applications of lipids; modulate bacteria to synthesize a lipid because it’s useful
- b. Transient lipid-protein interactions
